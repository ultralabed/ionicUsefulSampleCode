# ionicUsefulSampleCode
##This is a project created by ultralabed.

###In this project I use ionic sidemenu for base project.
###Since there are more and more lib available for hybrid projects. I recently find it is very time consuming to collect all the module I need for hybrid project, so I decided to collect them all while developing to help people who has the same problems. All the sample module will be insdie the sidemenu and can be selected when need it.

##How to start.
###Setup your ionic enviroment on your machine.
###Use cmd and go to project directory. Choose ios or android in the following cmd, or type twice to have both platform added.
### $ ionic platform add ios/android
### $ ionic build ios/android
### $ ionic emulate ios/android #or ionic run ios/android (if you want to run it on device.)
